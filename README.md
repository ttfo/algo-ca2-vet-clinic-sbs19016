Algorithms and Constructs CA2 (Vet Clinic) - CCT College

Lecturer: Amilcar Aponte

This is a CA (continuous assessment work) that I completed for the 'Algorithms and Constructs' module, part of the Computer Science lvl 8 course at CCT College.
The task was to create a working program to demonstrate a “Vet Clinic” as a prototype.
